# React-101
To Do:
 - Replace API request with github.com/akabab/starwars-api/ instead
 - Extract image URLs from JSON and Render on Website
 - Replace existing state with github API
 - Ensure any URLs that are generated (EG Films and Homeworld) are rendering values, not API URL
 - Can I implement github actions for this website?

 Some questions that were answered:
 - I was always unsure how all the engineers knew what to put in package.json, i now understand the package.json is created as like a template when you create a new react-app
 - Im starting to see differences between Raw JS and React JS, such as React doing hot reloads automatically where in Raw JS, you need to create a way to hot reload and reference it often
 - I see how compoenents can be used. While im still new to frontend, i liek the idea of compenets which are basically objects (if you needed to put it in C# language)
